__a super-simple gui to slide old photographs into TODAY__

TimeSlide is a prototype concept to balance the ease of applying machine-learning colorizing and up-sampling of old photographs without having to possess coding expertise or uploading your photographs to an online service. It is inspired by my desire to provide an easy-to-use *offline* option for my mother with her older family and ancestral photos. The goal is to give the people a secure and easy way to make your old photos look gorgeous. The application name is derived from the title of an episode of the amazing British sitcom, "[Red Dwarf](https://www.reddwarf.co.uk/news/index.cfm)," wherein [timeslides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeslides) provided much more interactive features of old photographs.

TimeSlide is really just pretty packaging (or an attempt of it, I'm a newb). The hard work is by the [deoldify](https://github.com/jantic/DeOldify) project, torch developers, opencv developers, tkinter developers, and all the other enabling technologies provided by selfless contributors to both the open source and free software communities. 

__Importantly, TimeSlide targets macOS.__ Currently, since it is based solely on python modules, you could certainly bundle a Windows application. But no support on that procedure is provided herein (though you're welcome to figure it out yourself and submit a PR). I haven't gone through all licenses yet and so do not provide a "release" here. But the instructions for bundling/packaging a distribution yourself is provided herein.

## Setup for Development

In macOS, install [homebrew](https://brew.sh). Then, use it to install Python 3.7 (*not* 3.8, since Pyinstaller is not compatible) with 
```
brew install python@3.7
```

Link it in your path with 
```
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/python@3.7/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

You may also need to install `wget` with brew:
```
brew install wget
```

Ensure that the `python3` command is correctly inked to the homebrew version with
```
which python3
```

Also verify here that it is python 3.7, or else just run `python3 --version` to confirm.

Next, run the bootstrap file which will clone deoldify, download the colorizing models, download the opencv (up-sampling) models, install `libgpng` through homebrew, and install all python requirements in a virtual environment. Edit it as required, then run
```
source bootstrap.sh
```

## Execute TimeSlide for Development

After activating the python virtual environment (`source venv/bin/activate`), simply run the python script:
```
python timeslide.py
```

## Bundle for macOS

Since the whole point of TimeSlide is ease of use, we require a solution for bundling the app that can be distributed to others. To do this, first open the file `timeslide.spec` and ensure that the path to your homebrew (Cellar'ed) version of `libpng16.16.dylib` is correct (slight modifications may be necessary depending on version number.) 

Next, in terminal, run:
```
source bundle.sh
```

With this, pyinstaller will bundle the app, including all necessary python modules and dynamic libraries. It will be bundled into a single `.app` bundle (as well as a binary executable) under the `dist` folder. Additionally, the bash script will copy over the icon files into the `.app` file. I recommend running the binary executable first to troubleshoot, as you'll be able to see any errors that occur. 

## Running the Bundled macOS App

Please note that distributing the application to others will require that they enable unidentified developer apps (one-time procedure) to run on any somewhat recent version of macOS. This can be done by providing those users with the following instructions.

1. Press `âŒ˜` + `SPACEBAR`.
2. Type `term`. When the Terminal.app shows, click it (or hit `ENTER`).
3. In the window, type `sudo spctl --master-disable` (note double hyphens before `master`), hit `ENTER`.
4. Enter password as required, hit `ENTER`.
5. Open System Preferences.
6. Click "Security and Privacy." Make sure you're on the "General" tab.
7. Click the lock at the bottom left, and enter password.
8. Under "Allow apps downloaded from," ensure that "Anywhere" is selected.
9. Close System Preferences and double-click the TimeSlide app to run.
